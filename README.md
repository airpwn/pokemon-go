## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require drdelay/pokemon-go
```

## Usage

``` php
$auth = (new \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Auth\PtcAuth())
    ->setCredentials('PTCUser', 'PTCPass');
// Check the folder ./src/Auth for more Auth implementations

$client = (new \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Client())
    ->setCache(...) // Any PSR-6 compliant cache (Optional for Ptc/GoogleAuth, **necessary** for GoogleOAuth, recommended always)
    ->setAuth($auth) // Anything implementing \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Auth\AuthInterface
    ->setLogger(...); // Optional, any PSR-3 compliant logger

$client->setLocation(...); // A \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Geography\Coordinate
$playerData = $client->login(); // Returns an instance of \POGOProtos\Data\PlayerData

$response = $client->sendRequest(...); // Define own requests by implementing \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Request\ApiRequestInterface / extending \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Request\AbstractApiRequest
// See \DrDelay\PokemonGo\Request\ApiRequests\GetPlayerRequest as an example
```

## Issues of this dev branch

- Protobufs: read_bytes len = 0
- Protobufs: did not read the full length

## Google login

There are currently 2 implementations of the Google login (see [#1](https://github.com/DrDelay/pokemon-go/pull/1)):
- GoogleAuth: You have to provide your Google account credentials
- GoogleOAuth: You do **not** have to provide your Google account credentials, but do the Google OAuth process by entering a code on *google.com/device* (being logged in **there**)

## Google OAuth login

If you login with GoogleOAuth you should catch `\DrDelay\PokemonGo\Auth\DeviceNotVerifiedException` at the login call. It gets raised if a verification on the google website is needed.

See the message, and the `getVerificationUrl` / `getUserCode` methods
